# 2024-LEGO-First
This is our repo for storing the code and scripts for our entry into Lego First Robotics this year
    
## Setup
[Pybricks]() is the current platform we're using, which has it's own IDE. 

[Using Pybricks with VSCode](https://pybricks.com/project/pybricks-other-editors/) can also work, and this link helps enable that.

## Examples
[Concurrent Motions](./ConcurrentMotions.py)
