# Project Board

This document describes the engineering process the kids have taken to arrive at the solutions that we're presenting

## Outline

- old design
	- add pictures
	- light description
- Judges responses
	- not 4 motors
	- too high
- new coding on pie bricks
	- pictures
	- new design pics (gears etc)
    - benefits of new system (measurement-driven, better precision in python than the Spike implementation)
- showing how the robot will work and what it does
	- do a run (but cut it off if it is close to the edge)
